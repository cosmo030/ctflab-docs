import { Aside, Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Create managed event workspaces with auto-created channels, roles, and dedicated leaderboards for competitive tournaments.

<Aside type="tip">
Events are perfect for hosting time-limited CTF tournaments or themed competitions.
</Aside>

## `/setup [event_name]`

Launch the interactive event setup wizard.

**Usage:** `/setup "Spring CTF 2026"`

**What it does:**

1. **Event Creation**
   - Bot creates a Discord category with the event name
   - Automatically creates a dedicated role for event members
   - Sets up permissions (event members can access, others can't)

2. **Preset Selection**
   Choose one of three channel layouts:

   **Team CTF Preset** (Most comprehensive)
   - `challenges-forum` — organized challenge threads
   - `leaderboard` — dedicated scoreboard
   - `general` — announcements and chat
   - `credentials` — shared resources/hints
   - `notes` — collaborative notes
   - `solves` — challenge solutions showcase
   - `voice` — voice chat for team coordination
   - Custom topic channels (optional)

   **EDU/University Preset** (Streamlined)
   - `challenges-forum`
   - `leaderboard`
   - `general`

   **Minimal Preset** (Lightweight)
   - `challenges-forum`
   - `leaderboard`

3. **Optional Custom Channels**
   - Add topic-specific channels (e.g., "Web Challenges", "Crypto Hints")

4. **Activation**
   - Event workspace is live
   - Join panel posted to `general` with join/leave buttons
   - Members click to join and get the event role

## Event Features

### Separate Leaderboard
Each event has its own independent leaderboard that updates in real-time:
- Shows only challenges created in that event
- Unaffected by guild-wide solves
- Uses same scoring mode as guild (solve-count or points)
- Includes first-blood bonuses if enabled

### Role-Based Access
- **Event Role** — automatically assigned when members join
- **Permissions** — event channels only visible to members with the role
- **Easy Exit** — members can leave anytime with a button click

### Points Carry Over
- If guild has points mode enabled, event leaderboards also use points
- First-blood bonuses apply within the event

---

## `/event-purge [event_name]`

Completely remove an event workspace and all associated data.

**Usage:** `/event-purge "Spring CTF 2026"`

**What it removes:**
- ✓ Discord category and all channels
- ✓ Event role
- ✓ Database records (challenges and solves within that event)
- ✓ Event leaderboard message

**Warning:** This is **irreversible**. All event challenges and solve history are permanently deleted.

**Step 1: Create Event**

```

**Step 2: Invite Participants**
- Share the server invite
- Members click the join panel to enter the event workspace

**Step 3: Create Challenges**

- Challenges automatically scoped to that event

**Step 4: Monitor Progress**
- View the event leaderboard in real-time

- All event data cleaned up

## Tips & Best Practices

<Card title="Keep Events Focused">

<Card title="Use Team CTF for Competitions">
The Team CTF preset with voice channels is great for coordinated team play.
</Card>

<Card title="Role-Based Permissions">
Event role assignments automatically restrict channel access. No manual permission tweaking needed.

<Card title="Separate Scorekeeping">
Event leaderboards are completely independent. Doesn't interfere with guild-wide rankings.
